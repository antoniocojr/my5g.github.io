# my5G Initiative

The main objective of the my5G initiative is to make 5G software systems accessible also to non-experts. Moreover, the initiative is interested in allowing the use of software systems in a large variety of scenarios. Finally, my5G initiative aims to create a friendly environment for students, researchers, and practitioners to learn about and contribute to 5G software systems.

Currently, the main project under the my5G initiative are:
* [my5G-core](https://github.com/my5G/my5G-core) - a 5G Standlone core following the 3GPP standards.
* [UE-IoT-non3GPP](https://github.com/my5G/UE-IoT-non3GPP) - virtual UE able to integrate IoT non3GPP devices (e.g., LoRa) to 5G networks. 
* [my5G-RANtester](https://github.com/my5G/my5G-RANtester) - an NGAP tester that can emulate UEs and gNBs.
