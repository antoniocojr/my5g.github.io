# my5G Initiative

The main objective of the my5G initiative is to make 5G software systems accessible also to non-experts. Moreover, the initiative is interested in allowing the use of 5G software systems in a large variety of scenarios. Finally, my5G initiative aims to create a friendly environment for students, researchers, and practitioners to learn about and contribute to 5G software systems.

The figure below illustrates some 5G software systems under development or planned to be developed in the my5G iniative and how they can be integrated. The figure also illustrates some potencial scenarios in which my5G software can be used, such as integration of multiple access networks in a single 5G core, support for non-3GPP networks (including IoT, e.g., LoRa), emulation of 5G UE and gNB, among others.

Currently, the main project under the my5G initiative are:
* [my5G-core](https://github.com/my5G/my5G-core) - a 5G Standlone core following the 3GPP standards.
* [my5G-non3GPP-access](https://github.com/my5G/my5G-non3GPP-access) - security connection using untrusted non3GPP.
* [my5G-non3GPP-IoTSDGw](https://github.com/my5G/my5G-non3GPP-IoTSDGw) - Software-Defined Gateway for IoT devices. 
* [my5G-RANTester](https://github.com/my5G/my5G-RANTester) - an NGAP tester that can emulate UEs and gNBs.

## Learning materials

* [IEEE NetSoft tutorial - 2020](https://github.com/LABORA-INF-UFG/NetSoft2020-Tutorial4) - This tutorial aims to explore the softwarization in the 5G systems.
* [SBrT'2020 course - 2020](https://github.com/LABORA-INF-UFG/SBrT2020-Minicurso1) - This course explores 5GC internals through an open-source implementation.
